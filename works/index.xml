      <description>MagniFinger Abstract MagniFinger is a fingertip-worn microscopy device that augments the limited abilities of human visual and tactile sensory systems in micrometer-scale environments. MagniFinger makes use of the finger&amp;rsquo;s dexterous motor skills to achieve precise and intuitive control while allowing the user to observe the desired position by placing a fingertip. To implement the fingertip-sized device and its tactile display, we have built a system comprising a ball lens, an image sensor, and a thin piezoelectric actuator.</description>

      <description>Temari Abstract To provide cultural night experiences with tourists in Kanazawa City, we have developped and exhibited our interactive digital installation titled &amp;ldquo;Temari and Shadow&amp;rdquo; at the open space of the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa. Our installation utilizes shadows cast by people standing in front of a projector. We chose Kanazawa&amp;rsquo;s Kaga Temari, a hand-sized colorful toy ball made of thread, as a motif of this work.</description>

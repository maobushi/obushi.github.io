MagniFinger makes use of the finger\u0026rsquo;s dexterous motor skills to achieve precise and intuitive control while allowing the user to observe the desired position by placing a fingertip. To implement the fingertip-sized device and its tactile display, we have built a system comprising a ball lens, an image sensor, and a thin piezoelectric actuator. Vibration-based tactile feedback is displayed based on the luminance of a magnified image, providing the user with the feeling of touching the magnified world.\n Photo Gallery Apple peel.
